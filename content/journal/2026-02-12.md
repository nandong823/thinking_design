We don't have interesting problems to solve
AI is a tool, but we don't have something "meaty" to use it for

Can we change our PR process? Need to show that AI has reviewed the PR and you're addressed the comments (fixed or won't fix), that should be part of the PR descrption

Things on my mind this week, #revisit 
- I want to solve meaningful problems
	- It's not generating another report, even though the business asked for it
		- Amendment process, we didn't know we have until Dec 15 to submit everything
			- Ops doesn't even really care
- Only when we are solving meaningful problems do we care to be better at it
	- I suspect we are not producing much output, even if we are working quite hard at it
- I want to stand out as someone who knows what really matters, for the business and the team
- I want to feel safe when making changes
- I also want a holistic plan for when making changes to things
	- I should think of things as products
	-
