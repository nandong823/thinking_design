## Why am I interested?
- [I want to be impactful at my job]([[goal-be-impactful-at-work]])
- I also encounter a lot of friction at work, ones that slows me down and prevent me from [enjoying my work]([[goal-enjoy-my-work]])


## Part I - Understanding DevEx

> DX captures the quality of interactions developers have around the tools, processes, and people they work with when trying to get their job done.
